## Notebooks
1. tf1_keras_recap: The Keras network developed in this notebook serves as the basis for our subsequent experiments. Probably interesting for those who are not familar with TensorFlow and Keras.
2. mnist_dpsgd: This notebook is intended as a starting point and assistance for your experiments at the CTF.
